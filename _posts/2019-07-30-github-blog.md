description: Blogging on GitHub, or, how to misuse it for note-taking like this
---
I wanted something simple for kind blogging or taking notes. Although, when reading on, you may not think it is all that simple. Why not just use Wordpress or something that can be set up in 5 minutes? Oh well, I like to complicate matters. I was looking for something that is mostly file-based and can use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I didn't want something running on a database, I just see it as overkill for mostly text content.

I really dislike *heavy* websites that load megabytes of stuff for a few lines of text. I sighed with relief that it's not only me when I read Maciej Ceg≈Çowski's *[Website Obesity Crisis](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm)*. I would be just fine serving flat files, which is basically what this does. [GitHub and Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages) work as a static site generator. It is to get a very basic system set up, but to give it more oomph, I had to piece together information from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Liquid](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid), and wanted to keep some notes in one place.

I have also a [repo](https://github.com/Primozz/blogtest) where I played around with the initial versions.
